NLP Sentiment Demo

This repository is a simple experiment in sentiment analysis using classical machine learning and lightweight NLP techniques.
It was created for learning purposes to explore text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation workflows.

âœ¨ Features

Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, stopwords).

Sentiment classification (positive / negative).

Example Jupyter notebook for training and evaluation.

Minimal, easy-to-read structure â€“ focused on concepts rather than production use.
